Query 5: `ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN bookshelf;`

- This query will modify the books table by removing the column named `bookshelf`. Now that the books table contains a `bookshelf_id` column which will become a foreign key, your table does not need to contain a string representing each bookshelf.
