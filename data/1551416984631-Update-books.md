Query 4: `UPDATE books SET bookshelf_id=shelf.id FROM (SELECT * FROM bookshelves) AS shelf WHERE books.bookshelf = shelf.name;`

- This query will prepare a connection between the two tables. It works by running a subquery for every row in the `books` table. The subquery finds the bookshelf row that has a `name` matching the current book's `bookshelf` value. The `id` of that bookshelf row is then set as the value of the `bookshelf_id` property in the current book row.
